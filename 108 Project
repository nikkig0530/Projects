Research Question
How does the popularity of soccer clubs within the Turkish league, Süper Lig, affect the injury rate and duration of players?

Background and Prior Work
Soccer is a sport played by over 250 million people and watched by billions worldwide. The FIFA World Cup Final Qatar 2022 reached a peak of approximately 1.5 billion viewers [1] while domestic leagues cater to millions of viewers each year. The game consists of players split into two teams of 11, each with different positions, attempting to shoot a ball into the goal of the opposing team. Positions vary by formation, but every team has a goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward. A typical match lasts 90 minutes and requires substantial physical effort from players. Therefore, sports injuries are a significant concern in professional soccer due to the impact on player performance, team success, and league dynamics.

In the context of soccer, clubs are often part of leagues. A league is a structured competition where multiple teams, typically called clubs, participate in a series of matches. Clubs are individual organizations or teams that compete in various competitions, including leagues. These clubs may also participate in tournaments and other organized soccer events[5]. However, the club’s primary affiliation is with a specific league, where they compete against other clubs in that league to determine standings, championships, promotions or relegations based on their performance. We will be looking at the data of a total of 20 clubs within the Turkish Süper Lig. Numerous studies have explored the epidemiology of sports injuries and factors contributing to injury risk. However, there are few studies that specifically look at how popularity of a sports league influences injury rates. One study by Hootman et al. observed the injury rates of NCAA athletes across 15 sports from 1988 - 2004 for each division [2]. They measured the injury rate as the fraction of injuries to the proportion of athlete exposures and found that injury rates were highest in Division I and lowest in Division III [2]. This study supports the idea that injury rates at higher levels of play may be more common. Another study by Hägglund, looked at injury patterns in European soccer leagues and found variation in injury incidence and severity among different leagues [3]. This study highlighted the importance of factors like competitiveness, playing style, and injury risk. Studies on player position conducted by Forsythe et al. studied injury data from all MLS teams from 2014-2019 and found that midfielders had the highest injury rate followed by defenders [4]. The researchers concluded that injuries were often specific to the position played such as midfielders reporting a higher number of leg-related injuries from running and defenders reporting a higher number of head and neck injuries from collisions. Despite this, there is a gap in literature regarding league popularity and player injuries. We want to understand how media exposure and more disposable income within a league due to popularity can impact player injury. More media exposure can contribute to pressure on athletes to perform at their best, which can potentially lead to higher injury risk and overexertion. Additionally, leagues with greater popularity and financial resources may invest in more sports medicine facilities, which could mitigate injury risks through improved medical support. Understanding how all of these factors relate to the rate of soccer player injury is key to optimizing player safety.
